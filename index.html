        <p>
          Anny is an instructional designer. She has been busy with developing
          communication courses’ formative activities recently. In her past
          experiences, she finds that students are not engaged in the
          traditional formative activities. To give students a more engaging
          learning experience, she decides to create a scenario-based activity
          with various branches based on students’ input. Nevertheless, she
          lacks the skill of programming and feels stressed because the deadline
          to publish this activity for students is fast approaching. Therefore,
          she made up her mind to find some tools she can use to simply the
          process of creating scenario based formative activities. We present
          KAT (Kiwi Authoring Tool) as a solution to target these problems. KAT
          is an easy to use visual interface that enables curriculum developers
          to create scenario branches for formative activities by just dragging
          and dropping blocks and making connections. The blocks cater to the
          instruction and assessment while the branches that link the various
          blocks cater to creating scenarios based on student input at every
          stage of the activity. Users can preview the activity as a student and
          make necessary changes. They can also share the created activity for
          others to edit or view. This allows for collaboration in a cross
          functional team. Anny finds KAT! By dragging the blocks and editing
          the videos, she creates a constructive feedback activity. The steps
          followed by her are described in the following pages. After publishing
          the course, she gets a very positive feedback from students that the
          activities are engaging. Anny is super happy and feels that the tool
          is very helpful.

        <p class="main-description">
          Anny begins the creation of her new branching scenario activity by
          creating a new project on the dashboard page. Here, she can also
          access her prior projects, or projects shared with her if she works in
          a team.

        <p class="main-description">
          To make the activity engaging and immersive, Anny can add videos to
          the scenarios. This is done by simply dragging a video block from the
          sidebar into the canvas. She can also edit the block to upload and
          trim a video, and drag to make a connection to its previous action or
          event. New users can get the hang of it quickly by following helpful
          tooltips.

          Anny can add student interactions, such as quiz questions, in a
          similar way. Questions can optionally have video feedback for rich
          explanations, and be linked with skills to help track students'
          learning progress.

          To have someone review her work or to collaborate, Anny can share the
          project with others by inviting them using their email addresses.
          Finally, the activity is complete, and students now have a chance to
          practice their skills.
