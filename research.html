                One limitation of collaboration is that it usually requires
                people to come to one physical space for better efficiency. How
                can we promote collaboration for Zazzle, an online platform,

                Even with professional co-workers, accountability and
                responsibility are still issues organizations find challenging
                to tackle. Collaborator can be late, lazy, or downright not
                working. Then, how can we ensure users behave responsibly in the
                creative collaboration we envision for Zazzle?

                With the intent to have expert designers help and guide novice
                designers, we found that such collaboration can be difficult
                without some mediation. For example, novice might not understand
                experts’ jargon and design tools.

              Besides creativity and collaboration, we were also interested in
              broadening the scope of collaboration by building a creative
              community where differents kinds of collaboration can happen.

              Similar to the values of collaboration, but communities often also
              offer the access to more pratical resources, such as the machines
              shared in the maker space we interviewed, which is the major

                User and scholoar interviews reveal an interesting fact that
                most people usually join communities for pratical reasons, such
                as the access to tools or tutorials. However, those who finally
                stayed, did so because of good social connections, meaning they
                had a good time with other community members.
