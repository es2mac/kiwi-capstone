            experience to help them master course competencies and feel
            confident to attempt the summative assessment. We have formed our
            research questions as follows, and used them to guide our research

            Feedback lets students know where they might have a gap in knowledge

            In a WGU course, many students are assigned to a single course
            instructor. While social presence is important for student’s
            success, instructors have limited time. Most formative assessments
            therefore need to be assessed automatically, and they need to be
            effective for the students without relying on the instructors.

            Busy, working adult students have to balance schoolwork with their
            job and family time. Since WGU’s formative activities are optional,
            the perceived value of doing the activities will likely be a big
            factor for whether students are motivated to do them.

            Some of the key concerns of good assessments are the sufficiency of
            material coverage, reliability of the observations, and validity of
            their interpretation. One way to improve these aspects is to have a
            variety of assessment types for a mixed collection of evidence to
            infer from, or “triangulate” for a better understanding of student
            knowledge. More robust assessment results can then be used to better
            inform student learning.

            Fun elements, games and other hooks can be helpful to gain students’
            attention but it needs more than these elements to retain the
            attention. Once we have grabbed the students’ attention, we must

            Many WGU students are busy working adults. They look at education
            not only as a source of learning but also expect such an education
            to advance their career as well. In other words, students have
            utility value expectations. Activities should be in alignment with
            such goals.
