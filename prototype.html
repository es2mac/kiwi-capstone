          <p>
            Using CTA as a basis for the activity design helps us break down
            complex skills, such as constructive feedback and active listening,
            and can help to avoid the issue of "expert blindspots." With the CTA
            model illustrating important decision points and their criteria, it
            could inform the design of the scenario branches, embedded questions
            and feedback in a way that helps students master the skill.

            <h2>Constructive Feedback</h2>
            <p>
              Introduction part consists of time, goal, and utility value info
              for students. Equipped with a big picture (goal), students will be
              more mentally prepared for the following activity and the time it
              consumes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following learning sciences’ contiguity principle, feedback
              appears on the same screen as the question. Successful learners,
              through eye-tracking, were observed to read a portion of text,
              search a diagram for the object being described, then read a
              portion of text, search a diagram related to that text, and so
              forth. (Hegarty, Carpenter, and Just, 1996).
            </p>
            <p>
              Other than objective questions, we provide learners chances of
              practicing and explaining. Research has shown that students
              perform better in Predict-Explain-Observe-Explain (PEOE) condition
              (Carvalho, 2018) in comparison with answering practice questions.

            <h2>Active Listening</h2>
            <p>
              The model emphasizes that there are three main phases of active
              listening. The first phase is about preparing your mind for active
              listening. This involves controlling your thoughts when you are
              passionate about a particular topic of conversation and also
              reinforcing that the goal of active listening is to participate in
              the discussion. The second phase is the phase when you are
              actually doing the active listening. One can be successful in
              active listening if they follow certain do’s and don'ts. The do’s
              include listening with an intention to participate, identifying
              topic words and sentences to organise information in memory,
              controlling the urge to respond immediately and keeping your own
              thoughts on the topic passive. The don’ts include listening with
              an intention to respond and comparing your thoughts with those of
              the speaker. Active listening is a metacognitive skill and thus
              needs some retrospection after every attempt of mastering this
              skill. So, the third phase is a retrospection phase during which
              the learner must try to introspect and find what worked well and
              what did not work so well in terms of the do’s and don'ts. Based
              on this, the learner must also plan how they will overcome their
              weaknesses of this attempt in the next attempt of the activity.

      <h2>Testing maker kit idea with physical assets</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-description">
      <p>How will introducing maker kit change users creating process and collaboration dynamics? To gain a better understanding, we conducted an experience prototyping and invited 7 participants without design background. Each of them was provided with a package of maker kits in three themes. They can feel free to use the materials to design either a T-shirt or a birthday card.
During the process, we also provided three types of guidance for the participants: face-to-face consultation, a live-chat conversation, or by watching a tutorial video. </p>
