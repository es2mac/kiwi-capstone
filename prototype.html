    <div class="section-description">
      <p>Through speed-dating, we were able to collect valuable feedback from our potential users. And it turned out that among all the ideas, the maker kit idea and the process visibility idea are the most promising ones.</p>
      <p>As for the maker kit idea, it helps to lower the barrier of creativity, yet protects the feeling of ownership as well. As for the process visibility idea, we identified that the process videos serve as both a source of guidance and inspirations. Besides, we also validated that users have the need for tutorials, but the tutorials need to be in an engaging format.</p>
      <p>Based on these insights, we decided to pick the maker kit idea as our main concept, and explore how other promising features can be intergrated into it and form a system.</p>

      <p>How will introducing maker kit change users creating process and collaboration dynamics? To gain a better understanding, we conducted an experience prototyping and invited 7 participants without design background. Each of them was provided with a package of maker kits in three themes. They can feel free to use the materials to design either a T-shirt or a birthday card.
During the process, we also provided three types of guidance for the participants: face-to-face consultation, a live-chat conversation, or by watching a tutorial video. </p>
