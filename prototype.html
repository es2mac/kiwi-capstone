          <p>
            Using CTA as a basis for the activity design helps us break down
            complex skills, such as constructive feedback and active listening,
            and can help to avoid the issue of "expert blindspots." With the CTA
            model illustrating important decision points and their criteria, it
            could inform the design of the scenario branches, embedded questions
            and feedback in a way that helps students master the skill.

            <h2>Constructive Feedback</h2>
            <p>
              Introduction part consists of time, goal, and utility value info
              for students. Equipped with a big picture (goal), students will be
              more mentally prepared for the following activity and the time it
              consumes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following learning sciences’ contiguity principle, feedback
              appears on the same screen as the question. Successful learners,
              through eye-tracking, were observed to read a portion of text,
              search a diagram for the object being described, then read a
              portion of text, search a diagram related to that text, and so
              forth. (Hegarty, Carpenter, and Just, 1996).
            </p>
            <p>
              Other than objective questions, we provide learners chances of
              practicing and explaining. Research has shown that students
              perform better in Predict-Explain-Observe-Explain (PEOE) condition
              (Carvalho, 2018) in comparison with answering practice questions.

            <h2>Active Listening</h2>
            <p>
              The model emphasizes that there are three main phases of active
              listening. The first phase is about preparing your mind for active
              listening. This involves controlling your thoughts when you are
              passionate about a particular topic of conversation and also
              reinforcing that the goal of active listening is to participate in
              the discussion. The second phase is the phase when you are
              actually doing the active listening. One can be successful in
              active listening if they follow certain do’s and don'ts. The do’s
              include listening with an intention to participate, identifying
              topic words and sentences to organise information in memory,
              controlling the urge to respond immediately and keeping your own
              thoughts on the topic passive. The don’ts include listening with
              an intention to respond and comparing your thoughts with those of
              the speaker. Active listening is a metacognitive skill and thus
              needs some retrospection after every attempt of mastering this
              skill. So, the third phase is a retrospection phase during which
              the learner must try to introspect and find what worked well and
              what did not work so well in terms of the do’s and don'ts. Based
              on this, the learner must also plan how they will overcome their
              weaknesses of this attempt in the next attempt of the activity.

          <h3>02 The Tool</h3>
          <h2>Overview</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="section-description">
          <p>
            Informed by research insights regarding ways of enhancing engagement, we discovered that authentic, useful, scenario-based activities, especially the video branching activities could be the key to achieve greater engagement. Nevertheless, considering the current tool available in WGU and assessment developers’ busy schedule, it is crucial that the creation of the activities be facilitated by educational technology. In other words, tools that can help with creating the interactive video branching are welcome and the utilization of the tool could assist in the scale-up process of engaging activities. Centered around this idea, we went through the process of low-fidelity prototyping to high-fidelity prototyping with the help of our target users, guided by learning sciences. So, next, let’s go through the design journey together.

            <h2>Low Fi</h2>
            <p>
              When we narrowed down the design idea to that of an authoring tool for branching scenarios activities, the first challenge was to create a shared understanding of what that might look like.  This is the goal of the initial paper prototypes, where we made quick sketches to communicate and validate the main ideas.  Starting with low fidelity allows us to get feedback and iterate quickly.

The initial sketches showed a dashboard for creating and accessing activity projects, inputting targeted skills at the start of the creation process, and working with blocks.  The blocks can be created, edited, and linked to create multiple branches.

            <h2>Mid Fi</h2>
            <p>
              The mid fidelity prototype is still light on visual details, but renders the main functions in a more concrete form.  Leveraging the insights generated from the paper prototype, we streamlined the interface, guiding users' attention on the main functions with a clear point of entry.

For example, on the homepage, the data charts are removed, and semantic wording is kept consistent throughout the page.  When a user starts a new project, they would see a single "start" block with guiding prompts, so they wouldn't feel overwhelmed.
            </p>
            <h2>High Fi</h2>
            <p>
The high-fidelity prototype is implemented with a sleek, modern dark mode UI.  In this iteration, we focused on a few critical aspects of testing feedbacks to further improve the functions and ease of use.

      <h2>Testing maker kit idea with physical assets</h2>

    <div class="section-description">
      <p>How will introducing maker kit change users creating process and collaboration dynamics? To gain a better understanding, we conducted an experience prototyping and invited 7 participants without design background. Each of them was provided with a package of maker kits in three themes. They can feel free to use the materials to design either a T-shirt or a birthday card.
During the process, we also provided three types of guidance for the participants: face-to-face consultation, a live-chat conversation, or by watching a tutorial video. </p>
